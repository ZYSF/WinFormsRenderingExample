# WinFormsRenderingExample
A (very) simple example of how to render programatically in Windows Forms (C#) using a Bitmap and a simple custom control.

While getting used to programming on Windows (primarily being a Linux user), I was looking for a simple description of "how to get some pixels on the screen" (ideally via a buffer) in C# and had to refer to a few different documentation pages to find out. So I figured I'd upload a very simple, braindead version of a custom, buffered control.
